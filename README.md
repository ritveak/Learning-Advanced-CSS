# Learning Advanced CSS
This is a repo that I made while I was going through an advanced CSS, SASS course by Jonas Schmedtman.
I have added comments everywhere, making the codes understandable.
I am sure you can use parts of the code in your own projects as well.
I myself am keeping this so that I can refer to it everytime I need a part of it.

Happy Coding ! ! !
